# MapDemo App

Welcome to the MapDemo App, an iOS application that implements mapkit and custom annotation. Following are main tooks and framework used in this project.

## MVC Architecture

The **MapDemo** follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in organizing the codebase by separating it into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and receives user inputs.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, managing user interactions and updating the Model as needed.

## UIKit Framework

The **MapDemo** is built using Apple's UIKit framework, which provides a powerful set of tools for constructing user interfaces across all Apple platforms. UIKit components are used to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the app's functionality.

## MapKit

MapKit is utilized in the project to integrate interactive maps into the application. With MapKit, you can display maps, add annotations, and incorporate location-related features, enhancing the app's functionality and user experience.

## Custom Annotations

The project showcases the usage of custom annotations on the map. Custom annotations allow you to display location-specific information in a visually distinct manner. This feature enhances the map's usability by providing users with valuable information at a glance.
